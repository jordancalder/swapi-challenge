# Description

This application serves as a way to explore the Star Wars API at https://swapi.dev. It is backed by a Ruby on Rails API and React.js client. API resources for planets and people are cached in a PostgreSQL database.

This application uses Ruby on Rails version 6.1 and requires Ruby 2.5.0 or newer. React 17.0.1 was used and generated by create-react-app; it can be found in the `/client` folder.

# Build

Before starting the server for the first time get needed gems by running

```sh
$ bundle
```

, run migrations with

```sh
$ rails db:migrate
```

, and install client packages with

```sh
$ yarn install
```

To start the server run

```sh
$ rails s -p 3001
```

The react client can be started by navigating to the client directory and running

```sh
$ yarn start
```

or from the root folder

```sh
$ yarn --cwd client start
```

It will listen for requests on http://localhost:3000.

# Test

Tests are written on the rspec testing framework. All tests can be found in the `/spec` folder. Run tests with

```sh
$ rspec
```

or

```sh
$ bundle exec rspec
```

# Items to note

There are a few known issues that have not yet been addressed.

- When exploring films resources, description newline characters break the formatting on the frontend. It's a known issue.
- Currently, links to other resources only populate the request field. Making the request is still required by user action. A couple approaches to eliminate that action have been thought out but not implemented.
